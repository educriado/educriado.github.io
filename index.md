## Hey!
My name is Eduardo Criado. I was born in Zaragoza (Spain) in 1995. 
I'm almost finished with my **Computer Engineering** Bachelor degree from Universidad de Zaragoza.
From August 2016 to June 2017 I spent a year studying at **KTH** as part of Erasmus exchange program.

At the same time I started working part-time at a **electronic music focused startup** called [Pocketbeat](https://pocketbeat.com).
I'm currently developing a **REST API** that is going to serve content to a mobile app that we are planning to launch soon! ðŸ˜Š
The technology I'm using to do so is **ASP.NET Web API** for developing, **TeamCity** and **Octopus Deploy** for **continuous integration** and **Bitbucket** and **JIRA** for control version and project tracking.

### Technical skills
Technical skills that I've acquired are:
* **Object-oriented** languages, such as **Java**, **Python** and a little bit of **C++**.
* **System administration**, specially on **Linux**, using tools like **Puppet**, **KVM**, **Docker** and **Windows Server** basic administration (IIS). I have used **AWS** and **Digital Ocean** droplets for cloud computing.
* **Scripting**, with Bash and Python.
* **Web frameworks**, like **ASP.NET MVC** and a bit of **Django** and **Express**.
* **Database administration**, specially **Microsoft SQL Server**.
