## Hey!
My name is Eduardo Criado. I was born in Zaragoza (Spain) in 1995. 
I'm almost finished with my **Computer Engineering** Bachelor degree from Universidad de Zaragoza.
From August 2016 to June 2017 I spent a year studying at **KTH** as part of Erasmus exchange program.

At the same time I started working part-time at a **electronic music focused startup** called [Pocketbeat](https://pocketbeat.com).
I'm currently developing a **REST API** that is going to serve content to a mobile app that we are planning to launch soon! 😊
The technology I'm using to do so is **ASP.NET Web API** for developing, TeamCity and Octopus Deploy for **continuous integration** and Bitbucket and JIRA for **control version** and **project tracking**.
